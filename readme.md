## Description ##

Customize Snapshots save the state of a Customizer session so it can be shared or even publish at a future date. A snapshot can be shared with a private URL to both authenticated and non authenticated users. This means anyone can preview a snapshot's settings on the front-end without loading the Customizer, and authenticated users can load the snapshot into the Customizer and publish or amend the settings at any time.

Snapshots are saved with a `scope` of `full` or `dirty`, which tells the preview how to playback the settings stored in the snapshot. A `full` snapshot will playback all the settings during preview, while the `dirty` snapshot will only playback the ones that were marked `dirty` when the snapshot was taken.

Requires PHP 5.3+.
